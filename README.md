# Web-based Application for Image Classification using Tensorflow.js

This example shows how to train the model on the photos of cats and dogs with Node.js and Tensorflow.js.

To run locally:
```
$ npm install
$ node main.js // to run the training script
$ node server.js // to run the local web server
```

The photos used here are from [The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/).
